## THREE PRICING OPTIONS

Based on research, here are three valid structures:

---

### OPTION A: FIXED FEE (Hormozi Cash-First Model)

**The principle:** Cash upfront creates operational runway. You don't discount. You deliver.

```
PHASE 1: $10,000 (60 Days)
├── $5,000 deposit (Day 0)
└── $5,000 milestone (Day 30)

PHASE 2: $36,000 (90 Days)
├── $12,000/month × 3 months
└── No commission, no performance component

TOTAL: $46,000 fixed
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum cash certainty
- No complicated tracking
- Positions you as premium
- Matches GHL Mastery's own model

**Cons:**
- No upside if they crush it
- Harder sell for first engagement

---

### OPTION B: HYBRID (Fractional Executive Model)

**The principle:** Base retainer + performance creates alignment. Industry standard split: 70/30.

```
PHASE 1: $10,000 (60 Days)
├── $5,000 deposit (Day 0)
└── $5,000 milestone (Day 30)

PHASE 2: $10,000/month base + 15% of revenue over $35K baseline
├── Month 1: $10,000 base
├── Month 2: $10,000 base + performance
├── Month 3: $10,000 base + performance
└── Performance cap: $5,000/month

TOTAL: $40,000-$55,000
```

**Example at $70K/month revenue:**
- Base: $10,000
- Performance: 15% × ($70K - $35K) = $5,250
- Capped at: $5,000
- Monthly: $15,000

**Pros:**
- Skin in the game
- Upside if they scale
- Easier to sell
- Standard in market

**Cons:**
- Revenue tracking complexity
- Lower guaranteed income

---

### OPTION C: PERFORMANCE-HEAVY (Hormozi Gym Launch Model)

**The principle:** You believe so strongly, you'll take the risk. Percentage of *increased* revenue.

```
PHASE 1: $5,000 deposit only (60 Days)
└── No other payment until Day 60

PHASE 2: 25% of all revenue over $35K baseline
├── Month 1: 25% of increase
├── Month 2: 25% of increase
├── Month 3: 25% of increase
└── No cap

6-MONTH TOTAL PROJECTION:
At $50K/month: 25% × $15K × 6 = $22,500 + $5K = $27,500
At $70K/month: 25% × $35K × 6 = $52,500 + $5K = $57,500
At $100K/month: 25% × $65K × 6 = $97,500 + $5K = $102,500
```

**Pros:**
- Massive alignment
- Huge upside
- Very easy to sell
- "I only win when you win"

**Cons:**
- High risk if they don't execute
- 60 days of work before meaningful income
- Requires trust in attribution

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: OPTION B (HYBRID)

### Why?

1. **Market Standard:** 70% of fractional executives use base + performance
2. **First Engagement:** You need guaranteed income while building case study
3. **Fair to Both:** They get skin in game, you get certainty
4. **Scalable Model:** Works for future clients at higher rates

## THE 33% CHECK

You wanted your fee to be ~33% of their earnings. Let's validate:

| Their Monthly Revenue | Their Monthly Increase | Your Monthly Fee | Your % |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|--------|
| $50K | +$15K | $12,250 | 82% of increase |
| $70K | +$35K | $15,000 | 43% of increase |
| $100K | +$65K | $15,000 | 23% of increase |

**At scale ($70K+), you're at 23-43% of the increase.** That's in the zone.

For Phase 2 total:
- If they average $70K/month × 3 months = $210K revenue
- Your fee: $45,000
- **Your percentage: 21%** of total revenue

That leaves 79% for them to:
- Pay commissions
- Run ads
- Scale internal operations
- Keep profit

---

## WHY THIS MATCHES THEIR MODEL

GHL Mastery sells CRM builds at similar pricing:
- Fixed project fees ($5K-$25K)
- Implementation + training included
- Handoff at completion

You're doing the same thing, but for sales instead of CRM. They should immediately understand this structure.

---

## RISK REVERSAL (From Research)

Include this guarantee:

**The Proof Guarantee:**
> "If by Day 30, we haven't generated at least 20 qualified appointments from your existing database, you can walk away with just the $5K deposit invested. You keep all the documentation, sequences, and learnings we've created."

This:
1. Guarantees deliverables YOU control
2. Reduces their perceived risk
3. Shows confidence
4. Is based on proven guarantee structures from research

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Confirm this structure aligns with your vision**
2. **Update all proposal documents**
3. **Update the site copy**
4. **Brief the dev agent on changes**
