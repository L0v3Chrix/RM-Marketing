## SECTION 8: PRICING RECOMMENDATION

### Based on Research, The Offer Should Be:

**PHASE 1: THE PROOF (60 Days)**

- Comparable to Closers.io first month: $15,000-$24,000

- Training + implementation packages: $15,000-$25,000
- Recruiting support value: $10,000-$15,000 per hire
- **Recommended:** $12,000/month × 3 = $36,000

**PERFORMANCE COMPONENT**
- Industry standard: 10-20% of new revenue

- **Recommended:** 10-15% of revenue over $35K baseline, capped at $5,000/month
