# RM Marketing Sales Department Buildout Proposal

## Project Overview

A custom proposal microsite presenting a phased sales engagement for RM Marketing (GHL Mastery). This proposal is designed as an immersive digital experience — not a PDF attachment — allowing Adam and Brendan to digest the opportunity in their own space.

**Prepared by:** Chrix (Raise the Vibe)

**Client:** RM Marketing / GHL Mastery (Adam McInnes & Brendan)

**Engagement Value:** $44,000-$50,000+ (progressive Phase 1 + $36K buildout) + commission + monthly support

*This proposal is valued at $500. It tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it—even if you don't work with us.*

## The Opportunity

RM Marketing has **solid funnel fundamentals**. They're not broken — they're constrained. They have:

- ✅ 19.3% lead-to-appointment rate (above avg for warm paid leads)
- ✅ $68 cost per qualified show (competitive: $100-300 typical)
- ✅ 3-5x true LTV:CAC ratio (healthy threshold: 3x)
- ✅ 10,000-contact dormant database
- ✅ Massive addressable market (frustrated GHL users)

They're missing:

- ❌ Dedicated sales team (Adam doing it alone)
- ❌ Capacity to work leads consistently
- ❌ Database reactivation
- ❌ Failed payment recovery ($25K leaking)
- ❌ Time for Adam to create content

**We will prove the model in 30 days, then build the full sales department.**

## The Meta-Point

**We're doing for your sales system what you do for others' GHL systems.**

You teach people how to build systems in GoHighLevel. Your clients pay you because they don't want to figure it out themselves. This is that, but for your sales department.

## Design Approach

**NO stock photos. NO hero videos. Data visualizations ARE the visuals.**

The site should look like a Stripe dashboard meets a consulting pitch deck:
- Dark theme matching GHL Mastery brand
- Gold/blue accents
- Animated metric cards
- Charts and graphs illustrating the math
- Clean, premium, data-rich

**Example Site Reference:** See `/mnt/rm-marketing/Exsample Site frame work/` for visual framework screenshots from contentcreator.ai
