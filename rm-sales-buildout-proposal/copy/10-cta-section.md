## Option A: Simple and Direct

### Headline
# Ready to Build Your Sales Department?

### Body
You've seen the data. You know what's broken. You know what it's costing you.

The question isn't whether you need this.

The question is how long you're willing to wait.

### CTA Button
**[Schedule a Call with Chrix →]**

### Supporting Text
*30 minutes. No pressure. Let's see if this is the right fit.*

**Phase 1 Quota:** $36K in 30 days

## Option B: Summary + CTA

### Headline
# Let's Turn Potential Into Revenue

### Recap Cards

| What You Have | What's Missing | What We Build |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Products that work | Sales infrastructure | Complete system |
| Leads at $6 each | Conversion engine | Team + process |
| 10,000 contacts | Activation strategy | Revenue machine |

### Body
You're sitting on a million-dollar business.

In 90 days, you could have the sales department to actually capture it.

### CTA Button
**[Let's Talk →]**

## Option C: Urgency Angle

### Headline
# Every Month You Wait Costs $15,000-30,000

### Body
That's not a scare tactic. That's the math.

- $5,000+ in no-show appointments
- $5,000+ in leads going cold
- $8,000+ in database decay
- $3,000+ in failed payment leakage

The longer you wait, the more you lose.

Let's stop the bleeding and build the machine.

## Sticky CTA (Optional)

For longer scroll pages, consider a sticky bottom bar:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Ready to build your sales department?  [Schedule a Call →] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Design Notes

- Primary CTA button should be prominent (large, contrasting color)
- Consider multiple CTA placements throughout the page
- "What happens when you click" reduces friction
- Secondary CTA (PDF download) catches those not ready
- Contact info should be visible but not dominant
- Mobile: CTA should be thumb-friendly
- Consider adding a calendar embed directly on page
