**WHO'S RUNNING THE PRESSURE TEST**

---

## Opening

You're not hiring a consultant who gives advice. You're engaging a team that sells, closes, and builds — hands-on.

## Chrix
### Raise the Vibe

**Title:** Lead Strategist & Closer

### The Short Version

20 years in sales and sales management. Built teams from scratch. Designed processes that scale. Turned struggling operations into revenue engines.

### What He Brings

- **Deep operational experience** — He's been in the trenches, not just the boardroom
- **Systems thinking** — Processes that work aren't accidents; they're engineered
- **Data obsession** — Every decision backed by numbers
- **Hands-on execution** — He doesn't just advise; he sells and closes

### His Role in This Engagement

**Phase 1 (Pressure Test):**
- Working your existing leads
- Taking sales calls
- Closing deals
- Database reactivation
- Documenting what works

**Phase 2 (Buildout):**
- Full systems architecture
- Hiring and training team
- Process documentation
- Handoff to your team

### Philosophy

> *"Sales isn't magic. It's math. Once you know your numbers, you know exactly what levers to pull. My job is to prove the model works, then build the machine."*

### Why Not a Bigger Team?

**Phase 1 is about proving the model, not scaling it.**

We validate that your funnel converts with dedicated attention. Once proven, Phase 2 brings the full buildout — hiring your team, training them, building systems, and handing it off.

### No Junior Staff

When you work with us, you work with **us**.

Not interns. Not offshore teams. Not junior associates.

Every call, every follow-up, every close — it's us.

### Aligned Incentives

We don't get paid the second half unless we hit the quota.

**We eat what we kill.**

## Design Notes

- Professional headshots are essential — invest in good photos
- Side-by-side layout works well for the two bios
- Consider icons or badges for credentials
- Track record could be displayed as mini case study cards
- Emphasize the "pressure test" framing — this is validation, not permanent
- Keep the tone confident but not arrogant
