## Key Messages

### Primary Message
*"You have the products. You have the leads. You're missing the sales engine. We'll build it."*

### Supporting Messages
1. You're sitting on a $1M+ opportunity that's slipping away
2. 65% of your appointments don't show — that's fixable
3. Your unit economics are excellent — you should be spending 5-10x on ads
4. A 10,000-contact database is gold, but only if you mine it
5. You need a sales department, not a sales person

### Proof Points
- $109,927 in 90-day revenue (proves product works)
- 5.5x LTV:CAC ratio (proves economics work)
- 75% VA retention (proves stickiness)
- $6 cost per lead (proves lead gen works)
- 94% decline in new customer revenue (proves urgency)
