## THE META-MESSAGE

This consultation document is worth $500 on its own.

It tells them exactly what's wrong, why it's wrong, how to fix it, and the exact steps to execute. They could hand it to anyone and follow it to get where they're trying to go.

**We're not selling advice. We're offering to execute it.**

## PRICING STRUCTURE (Option B - Hybrid)

### Phase 1: The Proof (60 Days)
- $5,000 deposit
- $5,000 at 20 qualified appointments delivered
- **Total: $10,000**
- **Guarantee:** 20 appointments in 30 days or walk away with $5K invested

### Phase 2: The Build (90 Days)
- $10,000/month base
- +15% of revenue over $35K baseline
- Capped at $15,000/month
- **Total: $30,000 - $45,000**

### Total Engagement
- **$40,000 - $55,000**
- ROI: 14-19x at $100K/month target

## DATA PRESENTATION (3 Silos - CRITICAL)

**Do NOT combine these data sets. Present each independently.**

### Silo 1: Advertising
- Ad spend: ~$1,500/90 days
- Leads: 238
- CPL: $6.30
- **Conclusion:** Marketing is efficient

### Silo 2: Financial (Stripe)
- Total revenue (90 days): $43K
- From appointments: ~$20.5K
- From database/nurture: ~$22.5K
- **Conclusion:** Multiple revenue streams

### Silo 3: Appointments (GHL Calendar)
- Booked: 46
- Showed: 22
- Show rate: 48%
- Book rate: 19.3%
- **Conclusion:** Good booking, show rate needs work

### The Hypotheses (Be Honest)
1. Low show rate = speed-to-lead problem
2. Revenue from appointments is understated (later purchases)
3. Database is gold (10K contacts, unworked)
4. $197 sales came from email blasts, not appointments
5. Data doesn't connect cleanly — and that's OK

### Benefits of Connecting Later
Once systems are in place:
- Can track attribution properly
- Will know which revenue came from which source
- Can calculate true revenue per show
- Can optimize each channel independently

## TEAM POSITIONING

### The Two-Person Advantage
```
When Chrix is CLOSING...   Sarah is BOOKING.
When Sarah is BOOKING...    Chrix is CLOSING.

No gaps. No missed leads. No "I was busy."
```

**This is how a sales department works. They've never had this.**

---

## WHAT THEY GET (The Playbook)

Even if they walk away, they keep:

1. Lead Flow System
2. Database Reactivation Protocol
3. Show-Up Sequence Templates
4. Sales Scripts
5. Hiring Criteria
6. Training Program Framework
7. Comp Structure Templates
8. KPI Dashboard Setup
9. Weekly Rhythm Documentation

**This playbook is worth $500. They could hand it to anyone.**

---

## THE GUARANTEE

> "If by Day 30, we haven't generated at least 20 qualified appointments from your existing database, you can walk away with just the $5K deposit invested. You keep all the documentation, sequences, and learnings we've created."

We guarantee what WE control.

---

## THE ASK

> "Give me the shot. Give me the testimonial. Be my first case study. Next time, I'm charging more."
