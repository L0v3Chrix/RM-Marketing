  20 qualified appointments?
  Yes → Phase 2 begins.
  No → Walk away, keep everything.
```

## Phase 1: The Pressure Test
### February (30 Days)

**Objective:** Prove the model. Close enough revenue to pay for Phase 1 and validate that this approach works.

### What Happens

**Week 1: Jump In**
We start working your leads immediately. No lengthy discovery phase. We learn by doing.

**Week 2-3: Active Selling**
- Database reactivation campaign launches
- No-show recovery sequences go live
- Failed payment dunning SOP created + Jonah trained
- Chrix + Sarah handling inbound appointments

**Week 4: Decision Time**
We review results. Did we hit quota? Are you confident in Phase 2?

### Deliverables

- Revenue from closed deals
- Database reactivation results
- Dunning SOP + Jonah training (failed payment recovery)
- Documentation of what worked
- Clear yes/no on Phase 2

### The Gate

| 20+ Appointments | Under 20 Appointments |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Second milestone paid ($5K) | Walk away with $5K invested |
| Phase 2 is a no-brainer | You keep all documentation |
| Momentum carries forward | We have data on why |

## Design Notes

- Timeline graphic is crucial — make it visually compelling
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 should be clearly distinct
- Decision gate between phases is the key visual moment
- Milestone table should be easy to scan
- Consider a "What you do vs. What we do" comparison visual
