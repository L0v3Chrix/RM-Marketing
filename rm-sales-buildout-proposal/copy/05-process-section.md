  [DECISION GATE]
  How much did we close?
  $20K unlocks milestone.
  $36K target = Phase 2.
```

---

## Phase 1: The Pressure Test
### February (30 Days)

**Objective:** Prove the model. Close enough revenue to pay for Phase 1 and validate that this approach works.

### What Happens

**Week 1: Jump In**
We start working your leads immediately. No lengthy discovery phase. We learn by doing.

**Week 2-3: Active Selling**
- Database reactivation campaign launches
- No-show recovery sequences go live
- Failed payment dunning implemented
- Chrix + Sara handling inbound appointments

**Week 4: Decision Time**
We review results. Did we hit quota? Are you confident in Phase 2?

### Deliverables

- Revenue from closed deals
- Database reactivation results
- Dunning sequence (failed payment recovery)
- Documentation of what worked
- Clear yes/no on Phase 2

### The Gate

| If $36K+ closed | If $20K closed | If under $20K |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| You paid ~$13K, made $36K | You paid $8K, made $20K | You paid $4K for 30 days of work |
| Phase 2 is a no-brainer | Good data, your call | We have data on why |
| Momentum carries forward | Still proved concept | You can pivot or pause |

## Design Notes

- Timeline graphic is crucial — make it visually compelling
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 should be clearly distinct
- Decision gate between phases is the key visual moment
- Milestone table should be easy to scan
- Consider a "What you do vs. What we do" comparison visual
