# Presentation Framework: GHL Mastery Sales Consultation

**Purpose:** This document defines the sections of the proposal/consultation and what each must communicate.

---

## THE META-POINT

This consultation document is worth $500 on its own.

It tells them exactly:
- What's wrong
- Why it's wrong
- How to fix it
- The exact steps to execute
- The math that proves it works

They could take this, hand it to anyone, and follow it to get where they're trying to go.

**We're not selling advice. We're offering to execute it.**

---

## SECTION 1: THE HOOK

**What it says:** You're sitting on a million-dollar business. You just can't sell it.

**What it communicates:**
- This isn't broken — it's constrained
- The opportunity is massive
- The only thing missing is capacity

**Key line:** "Your marketing is dialed. Your offer converts. The only thing missing? A sales team that can handle the volume."

---

## SECTION 2: WHY I'M WRITING THIS (The Backstory)

**What it says:** How I got here and what I found.

**Structure:**

### What I Came For
- Expected the podcast funnel — high-value appointments ($5K-$30K)
- Made myself available daily, asked to shadow Nick and Jonah
- Got crickets for almost 2 weeks
- Wasn't told this was prospecting/cold calling
- Would have evaluated the offer differently

### What I Actually Found
- Podcast funnel isn't the play right now
- GHL Mastery IS the validated offer
- They're good at coaching (even if they don't love it)
- They have clout, reputation, content, full offer stack
- 10K database sitting untouched
- Vetted dependable team (50:1 rarity)
- Haven't even touched their audience yet

### My Recommendation
- Don't chase podcast unless Nick figures it out (no bandwidth from Adam/Brendan)
- Pack office hours → upsell VA services
- Natural ascension ladder: content → group → 1:1 → VA → DFY
- This is the play. I'll show them how to do it.

### What I Actually Do
- The $30K → $100K gap is my lane
- Pay attention to numbers like my life depends on it
- Not the offer, customers, day-to-day — THE NUMBERS
- Metrics and KPIs never lie, just need to be worked
- This experience helped me find my offer
- Asking to be first case study
- 3-5 of these per year = happy

---

## SECTION 3: WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE

**What it says:** The gap isn't the funnel — it's everything around it.

**The Missing Pieces:**

| What's Missing | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Dedicated sales capacity** | Adam IS the sales team. When he's busy, leads die. |
| **Speed-to-lead system** | Leads cool off in 24-48 hours. No one's calling same-day. |
| **Show-up sequences** | 48% show rate. Industry is 60-70%. Half your appointments ghost. |
| **Database reactivation** | 10,000 contacts sitting cold. Zero ad spend required to work them. |
| **Failed payment recovery** | $25K sitting in dunning. Money already earned, not collected. |
| **Documented systems** | Nothing exists outside Adam's head. Can't hire into chaos. |
| **KPIs and tracking** | Can't improve what you can't measure. Flying blind. |
| **Team structure** | No setters. No closers. No accountability. No comp plan. |

**Key insight:** You can't hire a sales manager into this. There's nothing for them to manage. You need someone to BUILD the department first, then hand it off.

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

**What it says:** A team, not a consultant. A system, not advice.

### The Team

---

## SECTION 5: WHY THIS WILL WORK

**What it says:** The math proves it. The team delivers it.

### The Math

**Current State:**
- 238 leads / 90 days from ads
- 46 appointments booked
- 22 shows
- ~$43K revenue (mixed sources)

**The Problem:**
- Only ~15 appointments/month from ads alone
- Need 88/month to hit targets
- Gap: 73 appointments/month

**The Solution:**
- Database reactivation: 10-12/week = 40-48/month
- Warm lead follow-up: 5-7/week = 20-28/month
- New ad leads: 5-7/week = 20-28/month
- **Total: 80-104 appointments/month**

The constraint isn't the funnel. It's capacity.

### The Team Advantage

| Solo Sales Manager | Chrix + Sarah Team |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| One person doing everything | Division of labor |
| Closing OR prospecting | Closing AND prospecting simultaneously |
| Bottleneck when busy | Coverage when busy |
| Learning your systems | Building your systems |
| 6 months to ramp | Producing in 30 days |

### Why Now

Every month without a sales team:
- $15,000-$40,000 in missed revenue
- Database decaying (contacts go cold)
- Failed payments aging out
- Adam burning out
- Competitors getting smarter

**6-month delay cost: $90,000-$240,000**

---

## SECTION 6: WHY NOT COMMISSION-ONLY

**What it says:** I'd love to work commission-only. But you don't have what that requires.

### What Commission-Only Needs

For me to walk in and work commission:
- ✓ Validated offer (you have this)
- ✗ Documented systems and SOPs
- ✗ Checkout process optimized
- ✗ One-time offers configured
- ✗ Consistent lead flow
- ✗ Booked appointments waiting
- ✗ Defined KPIs and expectations
- ✗ Team structure and accountability

**You have 1 of 8.**

### The Reality

This thing is going to take 45-60 days to start producing consistently.

Cold engine doesn't fire on the first crank.

I can't work as hard as I'm signing up to work on hope and prayer.

### What I'm Asking

- $5K to get started (proves commitment)
- $5K at 30 days (when we've delivered 20+ appointments)
- Performance component in Phase 2 (when revenue is flowing)

**I'm not avoiding risk. I'm being realistic about the timeline.**

---

## SECTION 7: THE INVESTMENT

**What it says:** Prove first, then build. Progressive payments tied to results.

### Phase 1: The Proof (60 Days)

| Payment | Amount | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Deposit | $5,000 | Agreement signed |
| Milestone | $5,000 | 20 qualified appointments delivered |

**Total Phase 1:** $10,000

**Guarantee:** If we don't deliver 20 qualified appointments from your database by Day 30, you can walk with just the $5K invested. You keep everything we built.

### Phase 2: The Build (90 Days)

| Payment | Amount | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Base | $10,000/month | Monthly |
| Performance | 15% of revenue over $35K | Monthly |
| Cap | $15,000/month max | — |

**Total Phase 2:** $30,000 - $45,000

### Why This Structure

- **Low risk to start:** $5K to find out if this works
- **Performance aligned:** We earn more when you earn more
- **Matches your model:** This is how you price CRM builds
- **Fair to both:** Guaranteed income for us, capped cost for you

---

## SECTION 8: THE DECISION

**What it says:** You've seen the numbers. You understand the problem. You know the solution.

### The Options

**Option 1: Do Nothing**
- Keep doing what you're doing
- Adam stays on the phones
- Database keeps decaying
- $15-40K/month continues to slip away

**Option 2: Hire a Sales Manager**
- $80K+ salary
- 3-6 month ramp time
- Still need to build systems
- High risk if wrong fit

**Option 3: Work With Us**
- $5K to start
- Team producing in 30 days
- Systems built as we go
- $10K gets you to predictable pipeline
- Walk away if it doesn't work

### The Ask

Give us the shot. Give us the testimonial. Be our first case study.

Next time, we're charging more.
