**THE OFFER**

---

## Opening Context

We're doing for your sales system what you do for others' GHL systems.

You teach people how to build automations. Your clients pay you because they don't want to figure it out themselves. This is exactly that, but for your sales department.

This proposal alone is worth $500. It tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it—even if you don't work with us.

| Year 1 Investment | ~$60,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue Increase | $230,000-380,000 |
| **Year 1 ROI** | **4-6x** |

### Hire a Sales Manager ($80K/year)

| Systems included | No | Yes |
| Training | They figure it out | We provide it |
| Total Year 1 cost | $80K + mistakes | $44K + working system |

### Do It Yourself

| Factor | DIY | This Engagement |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Adam's time | 15-20 hrs/week | 2-3 hrs/week |
| Opportunity cost | Content not created | Content keeps flowing |
| Timeline | 6-12 months | 90-120 days |
