**THE INVESTMENT**

*or*

**PROVE FIRST, THEN BUILD**

---

## Opening Context

We're doing for your sales system what you do for others' GHL systems.

You teach people how to build automations. Your clients pay you because they don't want to figure it out themselves. This is exactly that, but for your sales department.

**This consultation is worth $500.** It tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it — even if you don't work with us.

We're just offering to execute it.

## Why This Structure?

### We're Not Avoiding Risk

The performance component kicks in when there's performance to share.

Until then, you're paying for construction, not commissions.

**Think of it this way:**
- Commission-only = I'm a closer waiting for appointments
- This engagement = I'm a contractor building the house

You don't pay a contractor commission on your future rent. You pay them to build something that produces rent.

### Matches Your Model

This is exactly how you price CRM builds:
- Fixed project fee
- Implementation included
- Handoff at completion

We're doing the same thing, but for sales instead of CRM.

### No Equity. No Perpetuity.

**We don't ask for:**
- Equity in your business
- Perpetual revenue share
- Ongoing licensing fees
- Ownership of anything we build

**When this engagement ends, you own everything. Forever.**

The systems. The processes. The playbooks. The trained team. All yours.

No strings. No trailing royalties. No "we get 5% of your revenue in perpetuity."

This is a consulting engagement, not a partnership. We build it, we hand it over, you keep 100%.

### Closers.io ($15-24K/month)

| Factor | Closers.io | This Engagement |
