## Opening

Let's look at what you've built — and what's limiting it.

GHL Mastery is a proven business. You have products people want, economics that work, and a market that's hungry for what you offer.

The constraint isn't your offer. It's capacity.

---

## The Numbers That Prove You're Not Broken

### Your Funnel Works

**17%** lead-to-appointment rate.

Industry benchmark for B2B coaching is 5-10%. You're nearly 2x the standard.

Your ads work. Your messaging resonates. Your offer converts.

**This is not a marketing problem.**

---

### Your Unit Economics Work

**5.6x** LTV:CAC ratio.

You spend ~$360 to acquire a customer worth $2,000+.

A healthy business needs 3x. You have nearly double that headroom.

**You could afford to scale. You just haven't.**

---

### Your Lead Costs Are Excellent

**$6** cost per lead.

In B2B. For qualified buyers interested in business automation.

Most people in this space pay $15-30. You're getting leads at a fraction.

**This is a strength, not a problem.**

---

## The Real Constraint: No One's Working It

Here's where the opportunity leaks:

### Capacity, Not Conversion

You generated 238 leads in 90 days. 17 appointments booked.

Those 17 appointments? Handled by Adam when he has time.

**There's no dedicated team working the leads.**

- No setters making calls
- No systematic follow-up
- No one's job to convert

When Adam gets busy (which is always), leads go cold. Not because they're bad leads — because no one's talking to them.

---

### Show Rate: Optimization Opportunity

**48%** current show rate (22 of 46 showed over 90 days).

Industry benchmark with proper sequences: 60-70%.

This isn't a crisis — it's a known optimization. SMS confirmations, pre-call videos, reminder sequences. Proven playbook. Just needs implementation.

**Improving to 70% show rate = 45% more effective appointments.**

---

### The Database: Untapped Asset

**10,000** contacts sitting in your CRM.

People who already know you. Bought something. Attended a webinar. Downloaded content.

*"Apart from the podcast stuff, we haven't marketed for our own leads much at all."*

That's a direct quote.

**This isn't a problem. It's a goldmine waiting to be worked.**

---

### Revenue Timing: Seasonal or Structural?

New customer revenue shifted in recent months:

| Month | New Customer Revenue |
|-------|---------------------|
| November | $33,936 |
| December | $8,885 |
| January | $2,031 |

This looks alarming in isolation. But context matters:
- Holiday seasonality (industry-wide)
- Founders focused on other projects
- No systematic sales process running

**The engine isn't broken. It just isn't running.**

---

### Failed Payments: Easy Recovery

**$25,870** in failed payments over 90 days.

Money people tried to pay you. Card issues, expired info, processing failures.

Standard recovery rate with dunning sequences: 20-40%.

**That's $5,000-10,000 recoverable with automation.**

---

## The Pattern

Every "problem" traces back to the same root cause:

**You have no sales team.**

- Leads go cold → No one working them
- Show rate suffers → No confirmation sequences
- Database sits idle → No one running campaigns
- Failed payments accumulate → No dunning system
- Revenue fluctuates → No consistent sales process

Adam is the sales team. When Adam is busy, sales stops.

**You're not broken. You're bottlenecked.**

---

## What This Really Means

This is actually good news.

You don't need to:
- Fix your product
- Change your offer
- Find new markets
- Rebuild your funnel

You need to:
- Install a sales team
- Implement proven systems
- Remove the founder bottleneck
- Work what you already have

**The hard part is done. You just need operational execution.**

---

## Transition

The question isn't "Is the business viable?"

The numbers prove it is.

The question is: "What happens when you actually staff it?"

That's next.

## Design Notes

- Use dark card backgrounds for metrics
- Green/gold accents for positive metrics (17%, 5.6x, $6)
- Blue/neutral for context metrics
- NO red crisis styling — this isn't a problem section
- Metrics should feel like proof points, not warnings
- Tone: Confident, analytical, opportunity-focused
