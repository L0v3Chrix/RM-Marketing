**WHY I'M WRITING THIS**

---

## Opening

This isn't a pitch deck. It's a conversation I need to have honestly.

---

## What I Came For

When I took this call, I expected the podcast funnel — high-value appointments in the $5K-$30K range. Pre-qualified guests ready for a conversation about their marketing. That's my wheelhouse.

I made myself available daily. Asked to shadow Nick and Jonah to learn the flow. Got crickets. Almost two weeks in, I hadn't received a single appointment.

I wasn't told this was a prospecting position or a cold calling position. Both of those things are in my skill set, but had I known, I would've evaluated the offer very differently.

## What I Actually Found

So I started digging under the hood. And what I found was interesting: the podcast funnel isn't the play right now. GHL Mastery is.

You have something most businesses would kill for:
- A validated offer stack
- 10,000 contacts in your database
- A real reputation in the GHL community
- Tons of content
- A vetted, dependable team that actually understands the software

That last part is rare. Maybe 50:1 among agency owners. Most people who sell GHL services don't actually know how to use GHL. You do. And you've trained people who do.

You're good at coaching — even if you don't love it. You have clout. You have a full ascension ladder sitting right there: video content → group coaching → 1:1 coaching → trained VAs → DFY builds.

You haven't even touched your audience yet.

## My Recommendation

Don't chase the podcast thing right now — not if it requires bandwidth from you. Let Nick figure that out in parallel if he can.

Instead, focus on what's already validated. The natural ascension is sitting right there:

1. Pack your office hours — get that Zoom room to 100+ people
2. People ask questions, you solve problems live
3. Natural upsell: "Want it done faster? Our trained VAs can build it for you."
4. Rinse and repeat

If I were the two of you, I would be dumping every dime and hour I had on this thing and bleeding it dry.

## What I Actually Do

This whole experience opened my eyes to my real lane.

The gap I solve: **$30K → $100K monthly revenue.**

Getting from $0 to $30K is incredibly hard — few people do it. But $30K to $100K is the same level of hard, just different problems for different reasons.

I pay attention to numbers like my life depends on it. Not the offer. Not the customers. Not the day-to-day. **The numbers.** Metrics and KPIs — they never lie, they just need to be worked.

It will look like magic when someone comes in and pays that kind of attention.

The problem that you have? I'm uniquely qualified to solve it.

## The Ask

Give me the shot. Give me the testimonial. Be my first case study.

Next time, I'm charging more.

If I did 3-5 of these a year — maybe got a small team to help — I would be very happy. This is my language, and I love helping the right business owners.

## Design Notes

- This section should feel personal, honest, direct
- No graphics needed — just clean typography
- Consider a pull quote: "The numbers never lie, they just need to be worked."
- This builds trust before asking for money
- Tone: confident but not arrogant, honest about what happened
