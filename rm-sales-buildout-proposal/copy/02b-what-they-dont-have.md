**THE GAP**

**WHAT'S MISSING**

## Opening

The funnel isn't the problem. Everything around it is.

## The Missing Pieces

### No Dedicated Sales Capacity
Adam IS the sales team. When he's creating content, leads die. When he's on a coaching call, no one's following up. One person can't do everything.

### No Speed-to-Lead System
Leads cool off in 24-48 hours. No one's calling same-day. By the time someone reaches out, they've forgotten why they booked.

### No Show-Up Sequences
48% show rate. Industry standard is 60-70%. Half your appointments are ghosting because there's no pre-call nurture.

### No Database Reactivation
10,000 contacts sitting cold. These are people who already know you. Zero ad spend required to work them. They're just... sitting there.

### No Failed Payment Recovery
$25K in dunning opportunities. Money already earned, not collected. Low-hanging fruit that no one's picking.

### No Documented Systems
Nothing exists outside Adam's head. You can't hire into chaos. New people have nothing to follow.

### No KPIs or Tracking
Can't improve what you can't measure. Flying blind on what's actually working.

### No Team Structure
No setters. No closers. No accountability. No comp plan. No one to manage even if you hired a manager.

## The Key Insight

**You can't hire a sales manager into this.**

There's nothing for them to manage. No systems to run. No team to lead. No processes to optimize.

You need someone to BUILD the department first. Then hand it off.

That's not a sales manager. That's a sales architect.

## Design Notes

- Visual gap analysis is powerful here
- Red/green or before/after styling
- Don't make them feel bad — frame as opportunity
- The insight box should stand out
- This sets up "What You're Getting" perfectly
