## General Questions

### Why does this cost $80,000?

You charge $500-$5,000+ for custom GHL builds. This is a custom build of your entire sales department — strategy, systems, processes, hiring, training, and optimization over 90 days.

The alternative is hiring a sales manager ($60-80K/year with 6-9 month ramp time), building piecemeal with freelancers ($30-50K+ over 6-12 months), or continuing to lose $15-30K/month in unrealized revenue.

The ROI math works. If we improve your monthly revenue by even $25K, you're in the black within 4 months.

---

### Why can't I just hire a sales manager instead?

A sales manager runs what exists. You don't have anything to run yet.

You need the infrastructure built first — the systems, the processes, the scripts, the tracking. Then you can hire someone to manage it. That's exactly what we deliver.

---

### What if I've tried other consultants before?

We're not consultants who give you a strategy deck and wish you luck.

We build working systems in your GHL. We recruit and train actual people. We stay for 90 days to make sure it works. Everything we create is yours to keep.

If previous engagements failed because of lack of implementation, this one won't have that problem.

---

### Do you guarantee results?

We guarantee deliverables — the systems, the documentation, the trained team.

We don't guarantee specific revenue numbers because too many variables are outside our control (ad performance, market conditions, execution by your team post-handoff).

That said, our performance bonus is tied to hitting $100K/month. We're incentivized to get you there.

---

## Process Questions

### How much of my time will this take?

About 2-3 hours per week:
- Weekly 30-minute status call
- Async approvals and feedback
- Occasional deeper discussions

We handle the heavy lifting. You stay informed and make key decisions.

---

### Do you need access to my systems?

Yes. We'll need admin access to:
- GoHighLevel account
- Payment processor (Stripe or similar)
- Ad accounts (view access preferred)

We treat your data with complete confidentiality. Access can be revoked at engagement end.

---

### What happens if something goes wrong?

We have a clear escalation process:
- **Yellow flag** (metric at 75% target): Discuss in weekly call
- **Orange flag** (metric at 50% target): Immediate strategy adjustment
- **Red flag** (declining week-over-week): Emergency intervention

We don't leave problems to fester. We address them in real-time.

---

### Can the timeline be accelerated?

The 90-day timeline is designed to allow for proper hiring, training, and optimization. Rushing hiring typically leads to bad hires.

That said, if you have existing candidates or systems in better shape than expected, we can potentially compress certain phases. We'll assess after the audit.

---

## Team Questions

### Who actually does the work?

Chrix and Sara. Directly.

No junior staff, no offshore teams, no subcontractors. When you hire us, you get us.

---

### How do you find the setter and closer?

Chrix has an extensive network of proven sales talent from his years at Deal AI and scaling multiple offers. We tap that network first.

We also use targeted recruitment — job posts, outreach, referrals. All candidates go through a rigorous vetting process before presentation.

---

### What if the person you hire doesn't work out?

Hiring is never 100% certain. Here's our approach:
- Rigorous vetting reduces risk
- Training increases success probability
- 90-day ramp period allows for assessment
- If needed, we help recruit a replacement within scope

Our goal is to hand you a functioning team, not just fill seats.

---

### Do you stay involved after 90 days?

We provide 30 days of post-handoff support included in the engagement.

Beyond that, we're available for:
- **Advisory retainer:** $5,000/month for ongoing strategic input
- **Project sprints:** One-off improvements at agreed rates
- **Team expansion:** Help hiring additional sales staff

But the goal is independence. You should be able to run this without us.

---

## Investment Questions

### Why is there a deposit?

The deposit covers our commitment to the project and the immediate work of Phase 1 (audit, infrastructure setup). It also ensures both parties are serious about the engagement.

The deposit is non-refundable once work begins, but subsequent payments are tied to completed milestones.

---

### What's the performance bonus tied to?

The $20,000 performance bonus is triggered when your monthly revenue reaches $100,000 in a single calendar month, verified by your payment processor records.

This aligns our incentives — we're motivated to not just build the system, but ensure it actually produces results.

---

### Can I pay in installments?

The standard structure already breaks payments across milestones:
- $20K at start
- $20K at team installation (Week 8)
- $20K at handoff (Week 12)
- $20K at $100K/month achievement

If you need a different structure, let's discuss. We're flexible within reason.

---

### What if I can't afford the team salaries after?

Before we start, we'll discuss budget for ongoing team costs. Typical ranges:
- Setter: $2,000-4,000/month (base + per-appointment)
- Closer: $0-2,000/month base + commission

If budget is a concern, we can design comp structures that are more performance-based to reduce fixed costs.

The team should generate more than they cost. That's the whole point.

---

## Scope Questions

### Will you run our ads?

No. Advertising management is outside this scope.

We will provide ad messaging strategy — the "I Hate High Level" positioning, headline examples, copy direction. But actual media buying remains with you or your agency.

---

### Do you build new products?

No. We work with your existing product suite.

You have great products (coaching, VA, custom builds). The issue isn't what you sell — it's how you sell it. That's what we fix.

---

### What about our other funnels?

This engagement focuses primarily on the main AOF funnel and database reactivation.

If you want us to integrate the cold outreach funnel or other systems, we can discuss scope expansion. Our audit in Phase 1 will clarify what makes sense.

---

### Can you help with just one part (like just hiring)?

This engagement is designed as a complete system. The pieces work together.

That said, if you only need specific components, we can potentially quote those separately. But the ROI is highest when everything is integrated.

---

## Outcome Questions

### How do I know this will work?

Your fundamentals are solid:
- Products with real retention
- $6 CPL (cheap B2B leads)
- 5.5x LTV:CAC ratio
- 10,000 contact database

What's missing is the sales infrastructure. That's exactly what we build. The math supports significant improvement if the systems are executed properly.

---

### What does success look like at 90 days?

- Show rate: 70%+ (vs. 35% now)
- Lead-to-appointment: 30%+ (vs. 17% now)
- Setter and closer installed and taking calls
- Database reactivation campaign executed
- All systems documented and transferred
- Monthly revenue trending toward $100K

---

### What if I want to change direction mid-project?

We have a change management process. If you want to modify scope:
1. We assess the impact (timeline, cost)
2. We discuss trade-offs
3. Both parties agree in writing
4. We adjust accordingly

Flexibility is fine. Scope creep without discussion is not.

- Group by category with clear headers
- Keep answers concise but complete
- This section addresses objections — important for conversion
