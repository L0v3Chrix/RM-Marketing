- Each deliverable should be a distinct card or section
- Consider icons for each category
- Value amounts should be visible but not overwhelming
- Total value callout should be prominent
- "What You Own" section is important — emphasize no dependency
- Maybe include a "What this would cost piecemeal" comparison
