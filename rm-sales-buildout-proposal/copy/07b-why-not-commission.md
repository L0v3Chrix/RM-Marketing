**WHY NOT COMMISSION-ONLY?**

*or*

**LET'S ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT**

---

## Opening

I'll be honest — here's what's missing that would make commission-only work.

## What Commission-Only Needs

For me to walk in and work pure commission, you need:

| Requirement | You Have It? |
|-------------|--------------|
| Validated offer | ✓ Yes |
| Documented systems & SOPs | ✗ No |
| Checkout process optimized | ✗ No |
| One-time offers configured | ✗ No |
| Consistent lead flow | ✗ Partial |
| Booked appointments waiting | ✗ No |
| Defined KPIs & expectations | ✗ No |
| Team structure | ✗ No |

**You have 1 of 8.**

## The Real Commission Math

Let's look at Adam's actual numbers from the last 90 days:

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total new customer revenue | $43,000 |
| From appointment shows (22 shows) | ~$20,500 |
| From nurture/database/self-serve | ~$22,500 |

Commission would only apply to the appointment-driven revenue — the $20,500 from shows we actually worked.

Here's what that looks like for 2 people over 90 days:

| Commission Rate | 90-Day Total | Monthly | Hourly (per person) |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| 10% | $2,050 | $683 | $2.13/hr |
| 15% | $3,075 | $1,025 | $3.20/hr |
| 20% | $4,100 | $1,367 | $4.27/hr |

**All below minimum wage for skilled sales work.**

Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. This isn't me being greedy. It's math.

## The Reality

This thing is going to take 45-60 days to start producing consistently.

There might be a few nice one-offs — God has a funny way of smiling on hard work. But I can't work as hard as I'm signing up to work on hope and prayer.

**Cold engine doesn't fire on the first crank.**

## What I'm Asking Instead

| Payment | Amount | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Deposit | $5,000 | Agreement signed |
| Milestone | $5,000 | 20 appointments delivered |
| Phase 2 Base | $10,000/month | Monthly |
| Phase 2 Performance | 15% over $35K | When revenue flows |

**I'm not avoiding risk.** I'm being realistic about the timeline.

The performance component kicks in when there's performance to share. Until then, you're paying for construction, not commissions.

## The Frame

Think of it this way:

**Commission-only = I'm a closer waiting for appointments**
- Great when appointments are flowing
- Terrible when building from scratch

**This engagement = I'm a contractor building the house**
- You pay for construction
- Then you live in the house
- Then we can talk about ongoing maintenance

You don't pay a contractor commission on your future rent. You pay them to build something that produces rent.

## Design Notes

- The commission math table is powerful — real numbers
- "Cold engine doesn't fire on the first crank" should be a pull quote
- The frame at the end reframes the entire conversation
- This removes objection before it's raised
- Tone: honest, not defensive
