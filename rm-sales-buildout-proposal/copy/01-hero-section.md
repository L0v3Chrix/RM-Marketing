## Recommended: Option A

**Primary Headline:**
# You're Sitting on a Million-Dollar Business.
# You Just Can't Sell It.

**Subheadline:**
A custom proposal to build your sales infrastructure — the team, the systems, the processes — so you can finally capture the revenue you're leaving on the table.

## The Meta-Point

*Include early to establish the frame:*

This proposal is worth $500 on its own. It tells you exactly what's wrong with your sales operation and how to fix it — even if you don't work with us.

We're doing for your sales system what you do for others' GHL systems.

## Intro Paragraph

You built something that works.

Your coaching program has real retention. Your VA service has customers who stay for years. Your custom builds solve problems people will pay $5,000+ to fix.

But here's the thing:

**In the last 90 days, you generated $109,927 in revenue. And you left at least that much on the table.**

41% of your appointments didn't show. Your 10,000-contact database sits untouched. No one is systematically working your leads.

You don't have a product problem.
You don't have a lead problem.
You have a **sales capacity problem.**

And we're going to prove we can fix it — in 30 days.

## Metric Callouts (4 animated cards)

Use properly benchmarked comparisons:

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 19.3% | Lead-to-Appointment | (Warm lead avg: 15-20%) |
| $68 | Cost Per Show | (Coaching avg: $100-300) |
| 3-5x | LTV:CAC Ratio | (Healthy: 3x+) |
| 22 | Shows in 90 Days | (No team to close them) |

**Visual note:** Each card shows a mini-comparison bar. Your number vs benchmark. The story: solid fundamentals, capacity constrained.
