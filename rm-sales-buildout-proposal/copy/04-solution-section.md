**THE SOLUTION**

*or*

**WHAT WE BUILD FOR YOU**

---

## Opening

You don't need advice. You need execution.

You don't need a sales person. You need a sales **department**.

Here's what we're proposing:

---

## The Big Picture

### Callout Box

**We will build your sales infrastructure — the people, the processes, and the technology — so you can scale to $100K/month and beyond.**

This isn't coaching. This isn't consulting where we give you a PDF and wish you luck.

**We build it. We install it. We train your team. We hand you the keys.**

---

## What "Sales Infrastructure" Actually Means

### 1. The Systems

Everything that happens automatically:

- **Show-up sequences** — SMS and email to get 70%+ attendance
- **Lead nurture** — Automated follow-up that converts cold leads
- **Dunning recovery** — SOP and training for your team to recover failed payments
- **Attribution tracking** — Knowing which leads become customers
- **KPI dashboards** — Real-time visibility into everything

### 2. The Processes

Everything your team follows:

- **Sales playbook** — Step-by-step guide for every situation
- **Scripts** — What to say on discovery calls
- **Objection handling** — How to overcome the common blocks
- **Handoff procedures** — From lead to setter to closer to customer
- **Quality standards** — What "good" looks like

### 3. The People

The team that executes:

- **Setter(s)** — Qualifying leads and booking appointments
- **Closer(s)** — Converting appointments to customers
- **Training** — Making sure they can actually do the job
- **Compensation** — Structures that attract and retain talent

## Why This Approach?

### Why Not Just Hire a Sales Manager?

A sales manager runs what exists. You don't have anything to run yet.

You need someone to **build** the systems, **then** you can hire someone to manage them.

### Why Not Build It Yourselves?

You could. But you haven't. Because you're busy running the business.

Every month you don't fix this is another $15-30K in lost revenue.

How many months has it been already?

### Why Not Just Get a Closer?

A closer without a system is like a pilot without a plane.

Where do the leads come from? Who qualifies them? Who books them? What happens when they don't show? What CRM workflows support the process?

You need the whole machine, not just one part.

## Our Approach

### Build, Don't Advise

We don't deliver reports that sit in folders. We build working systems in your GHL account.

### Install, Don't Suggest

We don't give you job descriptions and say "good luck hiring." We recruit, vet, and train the people.

### Prove, Don't Promise

We don't make claims without data. Every decision is based on your numbers, and we track results obsessively.

### Transfer, Don't Depend

We don't create dependency. Everything we build is yours. Every system is documented. Every person is trained.

When we leave, you have a functioning sales department. Not a consulting bill.

## What Success Looks Like

At the end of this engagement:

✅ You have a setter booking qualified appointments
✅ You have a closer converting those appointments
✅ Show rate is 70%+ (not 35%)
✅ Lead-to-appointment rate has doubled
✅ Failed payments are being recovered automatically
✅ Your database has been reactivated
✅ You have real-time visibility into all metrics
✅ Everything is documented and transferable
✅ **You're on track for $100K/month**

---

## What This Is NOT

To be clear about what we're **not** doing:

❌ **Not running your ads** — You keep control of ad spend
❌ **Not building new products** — We work with what you have
❌ **Not doing sales forever** — We build and hand off
❌ **Not giving generic advice** — Everything is custom to your situation
❌ **Not creating dependency** — You own everything we build

---

## The Bottom Line

You've built the hard parts.

The products. The expertise. The content library. The VA network. The dev team.

**Now you need the sales engine to monetize it all.**

That's what we build.

## Design Notes

- Use a professional, confident color scheme
- The "stack" should be visually impressive (maybe actual stacked boxes or cards)
- Checkmarks for success criteria
- X marks for "what this is NOT"
- Consider icons for each of the three categories (Systems, Processes, People)
- This section should feel comprehensive and reassuring
