# Master Strategy Document

## Core Thesis

**GHL Mastery is not a broken business. It's a constrained one.**

The funnel works. The economics work. The products work. The constraint is capacity — there's no team to work what they've built.

This engagement installs the missing piece: a functioning sales department that generates revenue while being built.

## Strategic Framework

### The Reframe

**Old Framing (Wrong):**
- "83% of leads never book" → Problem with the funnel
- "65% no-show rate" → Something's broken
- "Revenue declining" → Business is failing

**New Framing (Correct):**
- 17% lead-to-appointment is 2x industry benchmark (5-10%)
- No-show rate is an optimization opportunity, not a crisis
- Revenue "decline" is seasonality + no one working the leads

**The real story:** Adam and Brendan built something that works. They just don't have the people to run it.

## What's Actually Strong

| Element | Evidence | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Product-Market Fit** | 75% VA retention, coaching renewals | Products solve real problems |
| **Lead Generation** | $6 CPL from Facebook | Below $15 industry average |
| **Unit Economics** | 5.6x LTV:CAC | 2x healthy threshold (3x) |
| **Booking Rate** | 17% lead-to-appointment | 2x industry benchmark |
| **Tripwire Conversion** | 49% buy $7 offer | Strong engagement |
| **High-Ticket Market** | $5K+ sales closing | Market pays premium |

**Bottom line:** The foundation is solid. The business just needs people.

---

## The Constraint: No Sales Team

Every operational "problem" traces to the same root cause:

| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| Leads going cold | No one working them |
| Low show rate | No confirmation sequences |
| Database dormant | No one running campaigns |
| Failed payments | No dunning system |
| Revenue fluctuates | No consistent process |

**Adam is the sales team.** When he's busy, sales stops. When he's tired, close rates drop. When he wants to focus on content, leads pile up.

---

## Underutilized Assets

### 1. YouTube Channel (youtube.com/@adammcinnes)

Adam's YouTube presence is a significant underutilized asset:
- Quality content, professional production
- Established audience (organic subscribers)
- Great for warming leads pre-call
- Underused because Adam is overwhelmed

**The opportunity:** Adam should be creating content, not working leads. The content builds authority while the sales team closes deals.

### 2. 10,000-Contact Database

People who already know GHL Mastery:
- Previous purchases
- Webinar attendees
- Lead magnet downloads
- Tripwire buyers who didn't upgrade

**Conservative math:** 0.5% conversion = 50 new customers = $25K+ MRR

### 3. The "I Hate High Level" Positioning

Everyone in this space says "GHL is amazing!" But that's not what frustrated users feel. They feel:
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Embarrassed they can't figure it out
- Trapped (too deep to quit)

**Contrarian message:**
> "You bought GoHighLevel because someone told you it would change your business. Six months later, you're drowning. Sound familiar? We fix that."

This is rage bait for 2026. Pattern interrupt, instant qualification, trust through honesty.

## Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: Sell Immediately (Week 1)

**We start generating revenue Day 1.**

This is NOT a "build for 90 days then turn it on" engagement.

**Week 1 Actions:**
- Chrix + Sarah working existing leads
- Database reactivation campaign launches
- Current pipeline gets worked
- Quick-win automations deployed

**Expected Impact:** Revenue before month 1 ends
**Phase 1 Quota:** $36K closed revenue in 30 days

### Pillar 2: Build the Machine (Weeks 1-8)

**Systems installed while sales happen.**

| System | Purpose | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Show rate sequences | Get appointments to show up | Week 1-2 |
| Lead nurture | Convert non-bookers | Week 2-3 |
| Failed payment recovery | Recover $25K leakage | Week 2-3 |
| CRM cleanup | Proper pipeline visibility | Week 1-2 |
| Attribution | Track what works | Week 2-4 |
| KPI dashboard | Measure performance | Week 3-4 |

### Pillar 3: Install the Team (Weeks 4-12)

**Hire, train, and deploy sales team.**

| Role | Timeline | Responsibility |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Setter(s) | Hired by Week 6 | Book appointments |
| Closer(s) | Hired by Week 8 | Close deals |
| Process docs | Ongoing | Scripts, playbooks, training |

**End state:** Team operates independently, Adam does only strategy + high-ticket.

### Pillar 4: Activate Assets (Weeks 6-12)

**Monetize what's been sitting dormant.**

1. **Database reactivation** — Structured campaign to 10K contacts
2. **Cross-sell sequences** — VA to coaching, coaching to VA
3. **YouTube content leverage** — Pre-call warming, ad repurposing

**Expected Impact:** $50-150K from existing assets

### Pillar 5: Scale (Week 10+)

**Turn up the dial once systems proven.**

- Ad spend: $5K → $10K → $15K+
- With team in place to handle volume
- Data-driven scaling decisions
- "I Hate High Level" messaging deployed

## What Adam Gets to Do

The real value of this engagement for Adam:

**Stop:**
- Working leads
- Chasing no-shows
- Handling objections on basic calls
- Being the bottleneck

**Start:**
- Creating YouTube content
- Recording training materials
- Taking high-ticket $5K+ calls only
- Building authority
- Taking vacations

**The business runs without him in the sales seat.**

## Risk Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Team takes time to hire | Start recruiting immediately, leverage network, Chrix/Sarah bridge |
| Show rate doesn't improve | Multiple sequence variations, proven playbook |
| Database is cold | Segment aggressively, warm up with value-first content |
| Conversion drops at scale | Unit economics have headroom, monitor closely |

---

## Success Definition

The engagement is complete when:

1. ✅ Sales team installed and operational
2. ✅ Monthly revenue reaches $80K+ (triggers performance bonus)
3. ✅ Adam removed from day-to-day sales
4. ✅ All systems documented and transferable
5. ✅ Team can operate independently

**The job is done when they have what they need to hit $100K/month.**

## The Pitch to Adam

Don't change anything. Don't pivot. Don't exit the coaching business.

**The next 18-24 months is the GHL gold rush.** The market is massive, you're positioned perfectly, and the hardest part (product, positioning, proof) is done.

All you need is someone else to work the leads while you do what you're great at: creating content and showing up for high-value calls.

**We'll handle the rest.**
