## Product Suite Analysis

### 1. AOF Course/Blueprint ($197)

**Type:** One-time purchase
**Description:** Self-paced training on GHL fundamentals
**Commission:** 30%
**Role in Funnel:** Entry point for DIY customers

**Assessment:** Good lead qualifier. Identifies serious buyers willing to invest. Natural upsell path to coaching or VA services.

### 2. GHL Mastery Coaching ($497-500/month)

**Type:** Monthly recurring
**Description:** Group coaching, office hours, community access
**Commission:** First month
**LTV:** $2,000 (4 months average)
**Churn:** ~25% monthly (implied)

**Assessment:** Core revenue driver. Strong LTV but churn suggests opportunity for improved onboarding and engagement.

### 3. VA Services ($650-900/month)

**Type:** Monthly recurring
**Description:** Certified virtual assistants for GHL implementation
**Commission:** First month
**Retention:** 75% over 6 months (excellent)
**Current Clients:** 12 (10 at legacy $650, 2 at $900)

**Assessment:** Highest-value recurring product. Exceptional retention indicates strong product-market fit. Under-marketed — zero advertising currently. Significant growth opportunity.

### 4. Custom Builds ($500-5,000+)

**Type:** One-time project
**Description:** Done-for-you GHL implementation
**Commission:** 30%
**Volume:** ~1/month "if lucky"

**Assessment:** High-ticket, high-margin. Currently undersold. Discovery call model ($500) de-risks for both parties. Upsell opportunity from all other products.

### 5. Build Servicing (Variable)

**Type:** Monthly recurring
**Description:** Ongoing maintenance of custom builds
**Commission:** First month

**Assessment:** Natural extension of custom builds. Creates sticky, long-term relationships. Should be default offer after every build completion.

| High Ticket ($650-997) | $30,229 | 27.5% | 47 |
| Premium ($5,000+) | $49,750 | 45.2% | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **$109,927** | **100%** | **195** |

**Key Insight:** 45% of revenue comes from just 6 transactions (premium tier). High concentration risk but also proves market willingness to pay $5K+.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

| Source | Customers | Monthly Rate | MRR |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| Coaching (various tiers) | 7 | $197-597 | $3,382 |
| VA (legacy) | 10 | $650 | $6,500 |
| VA (current) | 2 | $900 | $1,800 |
| Other recurring | ~2 | $997 | $1,994 |
| **TOTAL** | **~21** | — | **~$13,676** |

**Key Insight:** True MRR is 3-4x what's tracked in their subscription system. Billing scattered across multiple systems.

### Revenue Trend (New Customers Only)

| Month | New Customer Revenue | Change |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| November 2025 | $33,936 | Baseline |
| December 2025 | $8,885 | -74% |

## Funnel Analysis

### Lead Generation (90 Days)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Leads | 238 |
| Cost Per Lead | $6 |
| Total Ad Spend | ~$1,428 |
| Tripwire Purchases | 117 (49%) |

**Assessment:** Excellent CPL for B2B. Strong tripwire conversion. Lead gen is NOT the problem.

### Lead-to-Appointment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Opt-ins | 98 (AOF) |
| Appointments Booked | 17 |
| Conversion Rate | 17% |

**Assessment:** 83% of qualified leads never book. Massive leakage. Lead nurture sequences could double appointments.

### Appointment-to-Show

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Appointments Booked | 17 |
| Showed | 6 |
| No-Shows | 11 |
| Show Rate | 35% |

**Assessment:** Critical failure point. 65% no-show rate is unacceptable. Industry standard with proper sequences is 60-80%. This alone is costing $2,000-5,000/month.

### Show-to-Close

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Showed | 6 |
| Closed | ~4 |
| Close Rate | ~67% |

**Assessment:** Actually strong when people show. Problem is not closing ability — it's getting people on calls.

## Database Analysis

### Size and Composition

- **Total Contacts:** 10,000+
- **Active (90 days):** 344
- **Dormant:** ~9,656
- **Source Attribution:** 56% tracked, 44% unknown

### Contact Sources (90 Days)

| AOF $7 Purchase | 45 | 13% |
| Appointments | 17 | 5% |
| CSM Contact | 8 | 2% |
| Other | 26 | 8% |

**Key Insight:** 44% attribution failure means optimization is guesswork. Must fix tracking before scaling.

### Database Opportunity

Even conservative reactivation yields significant returns:

| Scenario | Conversion | Customers | Revenue |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0.5% to $500/mo | 50 | 50 | $25,000 MRR |
| 1% to $197 course | 100 | 100 | $19,700 one-time |
| 0.2% to $5K build | 20 | 20 | $100,000 one-time |

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: Where are the $650/mo customers coming from?**
A: Legacy VA clients from original pricing. Product was launched at $650, now priced at $900.

**Q: Why aren't they in the subscription tracker?**
A: Billing system fragmentation. Likely manual invoices or different payment processor.

**Q: What's the cold outreach funnel?**
A: Separate funnel with 20%+ reply rate, selling only custom builds, has own closer. Produces the high-ticket sales.

**Q: Why isn't the main funnel being advertised more?**
A: "Apart from the podcast stuff, we haven't marketed for our own leads much at all" — per Adam. Non-VIP builds are ~1/month "if lucky."
