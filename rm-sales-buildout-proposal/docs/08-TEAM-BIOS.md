## Why This Team?

### The Pressure Test Model

For the 30-day pressure test, you're getting:

| Activity | Who |
|----------|-----|
| Strategy & Sales Calls | Chrix |
| Lead Follow-up & Scheduling | Sarah |
| Pipeline Management | Sarah |
| Closing Deals | Chrix |
| Process Documentation | Both |

### Why Not a Bigger Team?

**Phase 1 is about validation, not scale.**

We're proving the model works before building infrastructure. Once we've demonstrated results in 30 days, Phase 2 brings in the full buildout — hiring, training, systems, handoff.
