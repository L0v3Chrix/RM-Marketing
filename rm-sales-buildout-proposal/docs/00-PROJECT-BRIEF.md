# Project Brief: RM Marketing Sales Department Buildout

## Executive Summary

RM Marketing (operating as GHL Mastery) has built a validated product suite serving GoHighLevel users who struggle with the platform's complexity. They have product-market fit, profitable unit economics, and a massive addressable market. What they lack is sales infrastructure — the team, systems, and processes to convert their lead flow into predictable revenue.

This engagement will build their sales department from the ground up, installing the people, processes, and technology required to scale from ~$35K/month to $100K+/month.

## Client Profile

**Company:** RM Marketing / GHL Mastery
**Founders:** Adam McInnes & Brendan
**Industry:** SaaS Education / Done-For-You Services
**Target Market:** GoHighLevel users (agency owners, entrepreneurs)

### What They Do

GHL Mastery makes GoHighLevel digestible and doable. They serve the hundreds of thousands of GHL users who:
- Bought the platform but can't figure it out
- Are drowning in tutorials and complexity
- Don't want to give up but need help
- Need someone to just build it for them

### Product Suite

| Product | Price | Type | Commission Structure |
|---------|-------|------|---------------------|
| AOF Course/Blueprint | $197 | One-time | 30% |
| GHL Mastery Coaching | $500/month | Recurring | First month |
| VA Services | $650-900/month | Recurring | First month |
| Custom Builds | $500-5,000+ | One-time | 30% |
| Build Servicing | Varies | Recurring | First month |

### Proven Metrics

- **$6 cost per lead** (Facebook)
- **$2,000 LTV** on coaching (4 months average)
- **5.5x LTV:CAC ratio** ($360 CAC)
- **75% retention** on VA product over 6 months
- **~$12K MRR** current (underreported, actual higher)
- **10,000 contact database** (dormant)

## The Problem

Despite solid fundamentals, RM Marketing cannot scale because:

1. **No sales team** — Founders doing all closing, limited bandwidth
2. **65% no-show rate** — Appointments booked but not attended
3. **No lead nurture** — Leads going cold between opt-in and booking
4. **No database activation** — 10,000 contacts sitting untouched
5. **No tracking/attribution** — 44% of leads have no source data
6. **Revenue declining** — New customer revenue dropped 94% (Nov → Jan)
7. **No sales process documentation** — No scripts, no playbooks, no training materials

**Result:** They're sitting on a $1M+ opportunity that will never actualize without intervention.

## Why Now

1. **Revenue is declining** — New customer acquisition dropped 94% in 60 days
2. **Competition is growing** — GHL ecosystem is getting crowded
3. **Database is aging** — 10,000 contacts getting colder every day
4. **Unit economics work** — The math supports 5-10x current ad spend
5. **Team is available** — Chrix and Sarah are ready to execute immediately

The window to capture this opportunity is now. Every month of delay is $50K+ in unrealized revenue.
