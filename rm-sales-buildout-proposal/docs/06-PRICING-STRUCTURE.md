# Engagement & Investment Structure
## RM Marketing Sales Department Buildout

---

## The Meta-Point: We're Doing for You What You Do for Others

You teach people how to build systems in GoHighLevel. You show them exactly how to set up funnels, automations, and workflows. Your clients pay you because they don't want to figure it out themselves—they want someone who's already done it to do it for them.

**This is that, but for your sales department.**

This proposal alone is worth $500. It tells you exactly what's wrong, what to fix, and how to fix it. You could take this document and do it yourself. Most people won't—which is why we're here.

## Phase 1: The Pressure Test (30 Days)

### What It Is
Chrix and Sarah work your pipeline for 30 days. No fancy systems yet—just experienced people doing the work, documenting everything, and proving the model.

### Investment: Progressive Performance Structure

| Payment | Amount | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Deposit | $4,000 | Agreement signed |
| Milestone | $4,000 | When $20K closed revenue is hit |
| Performance Bonus | 33% of revenue over $20K | Paid on collection |

**Example at $36K Quota:**
```
Deposit:               $4,000
Milestone @ $20K:      $4,000
Bonus (33% × $16K):    $5,280
─────────────────────────────
Total if $36K hit:     $13,280
```

**Why Progressive?**
- You pay for performance, not promises
- We're incentivized to exceed quota, not just hit it
- Aligns our interests completely

### What You Get
- Chrix + Sarah working leads full-time for 30 days
- Database reactivation campaign
- No-show recovery
- Failed payment dunning implementation
- Documentation of what works

### Why This Structure
- **Low risk for you:** If we don't hit $20K, you only paid $4K for 30 days of dedicated sales work
- **Performance aligned:** We only earn more when you earn more
- **High reward if it works:** You've validated the model and have proof it scales
- **No-brainer to continue:** Of course you'll do Phase 2—we just showed you it works

### Ad Spend Requirement (Your Cost)

**Minimum:** $1,500
**Recommended:** $2,000 for the 30-day trial

**Why $2,000?** We need to generate in 30 days what you generated in 90 days:
- 243 leads in 90 days → Need 243+ leads in 30 days
- At $6 CPL: $1,500 minimum gets us there
- Buffer for conversion drop: $2,000 recommended
- Hitting the $36K quota is priority #1—we need the volume

The math at $2,000:
- ~333 leads in 30 days (vs 243 in 90 days currently)
- Even if show rate drops, we have the volume to hit target
- Allows granular metric tracking from Day 1

---

## Phase 2: The Buildout Sprint (90 Days)

### What It Is
We install a complete sales department. Hire, train, systematize. You end the 90 days with a team that runs without you.

### Investment: $36,000 ($12,000/month × 3 months)

| Month | Payment | Trigger |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Month 1 (March) | $12,000 | Phase 2 kickoff |
| Month 2 (April) | $12,000 | Day 31 of Phase 2 |
| Month 3 (May) | $12,000 | Day 61 of Phase 2 |

### Commission Structure

Commission kicks in 30-45 days into Phase 2 (once team is producing):

| Metric | Rate | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| New recurring revenue closed | 10% | First payment only |
| One-time sales (VIP, etc.) | 10% | On collection |
| Database reactivation | 15% | Higher % for found money |

### What You Get

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Setter hired and trained
- Sales scripts documented
- CRM optimized for tracking
- Show-rate sequences live
- Continued pipeline work

**Month 2: Build**
- Closer hired and trained
- Training program documented
- Cross-sell sequences live
- Team hitting stride
- Performance dashboards active

**Month 3: Scale & Handoff**
- Team running independently
- All SOPs documented
- Compensation structures finalized
- Ad spend scaling
- Adam transitioned out of sales

---

## Ongoing Support: Monthly Strategy (7 Months)

### What It Is
Monthly strategy calls + async support. We stay involved to ensure the team keeps performing and help troubleshoot issues.

### Investment: TBD (Discussed at Phase 2 completion)

Options:
- Monthly retainer ($2,000-3,000/month)
- Quarterly strategy sessions ($5,000/quarter)
- Revenue share continuation

### What You Get
- Monthly 60-minute strategy call
- Performance review and optimization
- Team coaching and calibration
- Scaling strategy
- Async Slack/Loom support

## Total Investment Summary

### Main Engagement (120 Days)

| Phase | Duration | Investment |

| Phase 1 | 30 days | $4K deposit + $4K at $20K + 33% over $20K |
| Phase 2 | 90 days | $36,000 ($12K × 3 months) |
| **Total** | **120 days** | **$44,000 - $49,000+** (depending on Phase 1 performance) |

Plus:

- Ad spend ($2,000 Phase 1, scaling in Phase 2)

### Full Year (11 Months)

| Component | Investment |

## The Math: Why This Makes Sense

### Conservative Scenario (Based on Fortune 100 Analysis)

**Current State:**
- Monthly revenue: ~$36,000
- Sales capacity: Adam (part-time)
- Growth trajectory: Flat

**Day 120 (End of Phase 2):**
- Monthly revenue: $55,000-65,000
- Sales capacity: Full team (setter + closer)
- Growth trajectory: 15-25% MoM

**Month 12 (End of Year):**
- Monthly revenue: $85,000-100,000+
- Annualized: $1M+ run rate

### ROI Calculation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Year 1 Investment | ~$60,000 |
| Year 1 Revenue Increase | $230,000-380,000 |
| **Year 1 ROI** | **3.8x - 6.3x** |

### Opportunity Cost of Doing Nothing

Every month without a dedicated sales team, you're leaving money on the table:

| Scenario | Monthly Loss | Annual Loss |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Conservative | $15,000 | $180,000 |
| Moderate | $25,000 | $300,000 |
| Aggressive | $40,000 | $480,000 |

**If you wait 6 months to do this, that's $90,000-240,000 you'll never get back.**

The math is simple:
- 22 shows in 90 days = ~7/month
- No one dedicated to close them = missed revenue
- Every show that doesn't close @ $3,600 LTV = $3,600 lost

### Upside Scenario

If everything clicks:
- Month 12 revenue: $120,000+
- Annual run rate: $1.4M+
- ROI: 10x+
- Adam fully out of sales, focused on content
- Ready to scale further

## FAQ

**Q: What if Phase 1 doesn't hit $20K?**
A: You've still gotten 30 days of dedicated sales work, database reactivation, and process documentation. You only paid $4K deposit. We don't get the milestone payment unless we deliver.

**Q: What if we hit exactly $20K?**
A: You pay the deposit ($4K) plus the milestone ($4K) = $8K total. No bonus applies.

**Q: What if we blow past the $36K target?**
A: You pay the deposit, milestone, plus 33% of everything over $20K. If we close $50K, that's $4K + $4K + (33% × $30K) = $17,900. But you also made $50K, so the math works in your favor.

**Q: What if we want to pause between phases?**
A: We'd rather you didn't—momentum matters. But we can discuss if circumstances change.

**Q: When does commission start?**
A: 30-45 days into Phase 2, once the team is producing. Not during Phase 1.

**Q: What's the minimum ad spend?**
A: $2,500-3,500 for Phase 1. Phase 2 we'll scale based on performance, likely $5,000-10,000/month.

**Q: Do you guarantee results?**
A: Phase 1 has a quota-based payment. That's our skin in the game. We don't guarantee specific revenue numbers—too many variables. We guarantee our effort and expertise.

## Summary

**Phase 1:** Progressive Performance ($4K down + $4K at $20K + 33% over $20K)
→ Chrix + Sarah selling for 30 days. You pay for results, not promises.

**Phase 2:** $36,000 ($12K/month × 3 months) + commission
→ Full buildout. Hiring, training, systems, handoff.

**Ongoing:** Monthly strategy (7 months, TBD pricing)
→ Keep the team performing. Scale further.

**Total 11-month engagement:** ~$58,000-70,000 (depending on Phase 1 performance)
→ Complete sales department, $100K/month run rate target.

**The bet:** $4K to find out if this works. More only when we prove it.
