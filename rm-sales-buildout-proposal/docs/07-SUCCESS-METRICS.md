# Success Metrics & KPIs

## Overview

This document defines how success will be measured throughout the engagement. Clear metrics ensure alignment, enable accountability, and provide objective criteria for milestone payments.

---

## North Star Metric

### Revenue Per Lead

**Formula:** Total Revenue ÷ Total Leads

**Current:** $109,927 ÷ 238 = **$462/lead**

**Target:** **$800+/lead**

This single metric captures the efficiency of the entire sales system. Improvements in show rate, close rate, or average deal size all flow up to revenue per lead.

---

## Primary KPIs

### 1. Show Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of booked appointments that are attended

**Formula:** Appointments Showed ÷ Appointments Booked

| Baseline | Target (Phase 1) | Target (Phase 3) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 35% | 60% | 70%+ |

**Why It Matters:** At current $213 cost per appointment, every 10% improvement saves ~$200/month in wasted spend and adds ~$2,000/month in revenue (assuming 60% close rate, $500 average sale).

**Measurement:** GHL calendar + tracking tags

---

### 2. Lead-to-Appointment Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of qualified leads (AOF opt-ins) who book appointments

**Formula:** Appointments Booked ÷ AOF Opt-ins

| Baseline | Target (Phase 2) | Target (Phase 3) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 17% | 25% | 35%+ |

**Why It Matters:** Doubling this metric doubles appointment volume without increasing ad spend.

**Measurement:** GHL pipeline tracking

---

### 3. Close Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of attended appointments that convert to customers

**Formula:** Customers ÷ Appointments Showed

| Baseline | Target (Phase 2) | Target (Phase 3) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| ~67% | 70% | 75%+ |

**Why It Matters:** Already strong, but every 5% improvement adds ~$1,500/month at current volume.

**Measurement:** GHL pipeline + payment data

---

### 4. Monthly Revenue

**Definition:** Total revenue collected in calendar month

| Baseline | Target (Month 3) | Target (Month 6) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| ~$35,000 | $60,000 | $100,000+ |

**Why It Matters:** Ultimate measure of business health. Performance bonus tied to $100K achievement.

**Measurement:** Stripe/payment processor reports

---

### 5. New Customer Revenue

**Definition:** Revenue from first-time customers only (excludes renewals)

| Baseline | Target (Month 2) | Target (Month 3) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| $2,031 (Jan) | $10,000 | $20,000+ |

**Why It Matters:** Acquisition health. Renewal revenue masks acquisition problems.

**Measurement:** Payment data filtered by first purchase date

---

### 6. Failed Payment Recovery Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of failed payments successfully recovered

**Formula:** Recovered Amount ÷ Failed Amount

| Baseline | Target (Phase 1) | Target (Phase 3) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| ~0% | 30% | 40%+ |

**Why It Matters:** $25,870 in failed payments over 90 days = $8,600/month leakage. 40% recovery = $3,400/month recovered.

**Measurement:** Payment processor + dunning tracking
