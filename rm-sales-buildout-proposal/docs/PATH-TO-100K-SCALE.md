# Path to $100K/Month
## The Math for Scale

---

## The Simple Truth

Scaling to $100K/month isn't about time—it's about two things:
1. **Ad spend** to generate enough leads
2. **Capacity** to take the appointments

With the right resources, this can happen fast.

## Working Backwards from $100K

### Revenue Target: $100,000/month

| Product Mix | Avg Sale | Sales Needed | % of Target |
|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Custom Builds | $7,500 | 10 | $75,000 |
| VIP Coaching | $5,000 | 3 | $15,000 |
| Coaching Tiers | $500 | 20 | $10,000 |
| **TOTAL** | — | **33** | **$100,000** |

*Custom builds are the lever. At $7,500 average, 10 per month = $75K.*

## The Funnel Math

### Current Metrics (Validated)

| Stage | Rate | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Cost Per Lead | $6.30 | Stripe/GHL data |
| Lead → Appointment | 19.3% | GHL data |
| Appointment → Show | 59% | GHL calendar |
| Show → Close | 30% | Industry estimate (needs validation) |

### Scale Funnel: $100K/Month Target

Working backwards:

| Stage | Calculation | Volume |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Sales needed** | $100K revenue | 33/month |
| **Shows needed** | 33 ÷ 30% close | **110/month** |
| **Appointments needed** | 110 ÷ 59% show | **186/month** |
| **Leads needed** | 186 ÷ 19.3% book | **964/month** |
| **Ad spend needed** | 964 × $6.30 | **$6,073/month** |

**Note: Phase 1 quota is $36K (not $15K) for 30-day pressure test.**

## The Scale Table

| Monthly Target | Ad Spend | Leads | Apts | Shows | Sales | Closers Needed |
|----------------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Current ~$36K** | ~$500 | 79 | 15 | 9 | 3 | 0 (Adam part-time) |
| **$50K** | $2,100 | 333 | 64 | 38 | 11 | 1 |
| **75K** | $4,200 | 667 | 129 | 76 | 23 | 1-2 |
| **$100K** | $6,100 | 968 | 187 | 110 | 33 | 2 |
| **$150K** | $9,100 | 1,444 | 279 | 165 | 49 | 2-3 |
| **$200K** | $12,200 | 1,937 | 374 | 221 | 66 | 3-4 |

**Key insight:** $100K/month requires only ~$6K in ad spend. The constraint isn't budget—it's capacity to take the calls.

## Revenue Per Show

This is the key metric for capacity planning:

| Target | Shows/Month | Revenue/Show |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| $50K | 38 | $1,316 |
| $75K | 76 | $987 |
| $100K | 110 | $909 |
| $150K | 165 | $909 |

**At $100K/month:** Each show is worth ~$900 in expected revenue.

## Capacity Model

### How Many Calls Can One Closer Handle?

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Calls/day | 4 | 6 | 8 |
| Days/week | 5 | 5 | 6 |
| Calls/month | 80 | 120 | 192 |

### Closers Needed by Revenue Target

| Target | Shows/Month | @ 80/closer | @ 120/closer |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| $50K | 38 | 1 | 1 |
| $75K | 76 | 1 | 1 |
| $100K | 110 | 2 | 1 |
| $150K | 165 | 3 | 2 |
| $200K | 221 | 3 | 2 |

**With Chrix at 120+ calls/month capacity, $100K is achievable solo.**

---

## The Chrix-Only Scenario

### Can Chrix hit $100K/month alone?

**The math says yes—if:**

| Requirement | Target | Achievable? |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Ad spend | $6,100/month | ✅ Client funds |
| Leads | 968/month | ✅ Ads will deliver |
| Appointments | 187/month | ✅ Calendar booking |
| Shows | 110/month | ✅ With show-rate sequences |
| Calls taken | 110/month | ✅ ~5-6/day, 5 days/week |
| Close rate | 30% | ⚠️ Needs validation |
| Avg sale | $3,000 | ✅ Custom builds push this higher |

**Bottleneck:** Close rate. If Chrix closes at 35%+, the math gets easier:

| Close Rate | Shows Needed | Calls/Day |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 25% | 132 | 6.6 |
| 30% | 110 | 5.5 |
| 35% | 94 | 4.7 |
| 40% | 83 | 4.1 |

With strong closing on custom builds, 4-5 calls/day hits $100K.

## Timeline to $100K

### It's Not About Time—It's About Ramp

| Week | Focus | Ad Spend | Projected Revenue |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | Prove close rate | $1,500 | $15K (existing pipeline) |
| 3-4 | Scale ads, fill calendar | $3,000 | $25K |
| 5-6 | Full capacity | $5,000 | $50K |
| 7-8 | Optimize, scale | $6,000 | $75K |
| 9-10 | Hit stride | $6,000 | $100K |

**With adequate ad spend and capacity, $100K is a 60-90 day target—not 9-12 months.**

---

## What Slows This Down

| Constraint | Impact | Solution |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Low ad spend | Not enough leads | Increase budget |
| Calendar not open | Appointments can't book | Clear availability |
| No-shows | Wasted capacity | Show-rate sequences |
| Low close rate | Need more shows | Sales training, qualification |
| Low ticket | Need more sales | Push custom builds |

**None of these are permanent blockers. They're optimization problems.**

---

## The Investment at Scale

### Monthly Operating Costs at $100K Revenue

| Item | Cost | % of Revenue |
|------|------|--------------|
| Ad spend | $6,000 | 6% |
| Closer(s) | $6,000-10,000 | 6-10% |
| Tools/software | $500 | 0.5% |
| **Total COGS** | **$12,500-16,500** | **12.5-16.5%** |
| **Gross Margin** | **$83,500-87,500** | **83.5-87.5%** |

At $100K/month, the business is throwing off $80K+/month in gross profit.

## Summary: The Path

```
TODAY                          $100K/MONTH
─────                          ───────────
~$500 ad spend      ──────►    $6,000 ad spend
~80 leads/mo        ──────►    ~970 leads/mo
~15 appointments    ──────►    ~190 appointments
~9 shows            ──────►    ~110 shows
1 part-time closer  ──────►    1-2 full-time closers
~$36K revenue       ──────►    $100K revenue

THE GAP: $5,500/mo in ads + dedicated sales capacity
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **$100K/month requires ~$6K in ad spend** — The ads work. Scale them.

2. **110 shows/month = 5-6 calls/day** — One strong closer can handle this.

3. **Custom builds are the lever** — At $7,500 average, 10/month = $75K.

4. **Timeline is about ramp, not time** — With resources, 60-90 days is realistic.

5. **The constraint is capacity, not the funnel** — The funnel works. Just need people to work it.
