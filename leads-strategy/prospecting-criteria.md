# Prospecting Criteria — Working Founder Podcast

## Ideal Guest Profile

### Hard Requirements

- **Audience Size:** 100,000+ followers on at least one platform
- **Engagement:** Active, engaged audience (not just vanity metrics)
- **Monetization Gap:** Currently relying on inconsistent brand deals, manual DMs, or low-ticket products

### Soft Signals (Good Fit Indicators)

- Complaining about tech stack or fulfillment
- Posting about being overwhelmed with growth
- Launching products manually or inconsistently
- High engagement but no clear offer or funnel
- Recently hit a milestone but struggling to capitalize

### Disqualifiers

- Already has sophisticated sales infrastructure
- Primarily B2B service provider (not creator/influencer)
- Audience is fake/purchased
- Not interested in high-ticket offerings
