# Lead Strategy — RM Marketing

Documentation for the Working Founder podcast lead generation system.

## Current Strategy Overview

### The Working Founder Podcast

**Concept:** Interview podcast targeting influencers and creators as guests, positioning them for follow-up conversations about monetization services.

### Prospecting Criteria

- **Minimum Audience:** 100,000+ followers
- **Platform Focus:** Social media (specific platforms TBD)
- **Key Signal:** Poorly monetized presence (large audience but relying on brand deals, manual sales, or low-ticket offers)

### Outreach Performance

| Metric | Current |
|--------|---------|
| Response Rate | 34% |
| Booking Rate | TBD |
| Guest-to-Call Rate | TBD |
| Close Rate | TBD |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What's the transition from podcast recording to sales conversation?
2. What follow-up sequence works best after recording?
3. How do we qualify which guests are actually good fits for AMS?
4. What content/value can we provide between recording and pitch?
